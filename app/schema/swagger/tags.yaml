    At this time, uploading via the API is not possible. We made a conscious
    choice not to add this for the following reasons:

    * Instagram is about your life on the go – we hope to encourage photos
    from within the app.
    * We want to fight spam & low quality photos. Once we allow uploading
    from other sources, it's harder to control what comes into the Instagram
    ecosystem. All this being said, we're working on ways to ensure users
    have a consistent and high-quality experience on our platform.
